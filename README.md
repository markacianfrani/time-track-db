=============
Project Goal:
To simplify payroll by providing an accurate automated system for tracking employee hours.

Target Users:
Employees:  TimeTrack will enable employees to record their hours by clocking in and out of the system.   Employees will also be able to review their hours.

Management:  TimeTrack will enable managers to edit employee time data and to view summary reports for the purpose of payroll.

Target Platform:
TimeTrack is designed to run as an intranet website.  The backend will be developed for an AMP server.

Vision:
Managers spend less time recording and calculating hours when processing payroll.  Employee hours are recorded accurately so that employees receive compensation for all hours worked.

Project Priorities:

Accuracy:
In order to be an effective solution for payroll hour calculations, the TimeTrack application must be accurate.  This requires safeguards against employee abuse of the system, and it also requires correct program logic in calculating hour totals.

Simplicity:
The TimeTrack system must take less time from employees and managers than paper recording and calculations.  In order to improve efficiency, the system must be simple to use for both employees and managers.
